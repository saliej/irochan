# irochan
A [Nim](http://nim-lang.org/) clone of the popular colour picker [Pixie](http://www.nattyware.com/pixie.php).

### FAQ

###### Why?
I wanted to learn Nim, and to see how easy/hard it was to create a WinApi app.  At the time it was written, there were no tutorials from writing Windows GUI Applications.

###### And?  How easy/hard was it?
Super easy if you're already used to creating Windows programs, and are familiar with C-style languages.

###### What does irochan mean?
"Colour child" in Japanese

###### Why isn't X/Y/Z implemented?
I basically only implemented the features I use.  I'll add more features when I have time or the need arises.  I probably will not be supporting conversion CMYK values.

###### Why didn't you do X using Y Nim/WinApi construct?
This was not meant to demonstrate idiomatic Nim or WinApi programming, although I will be updating the code over time as I become more familiar with the language and best practices.
